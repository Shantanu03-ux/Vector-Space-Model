# Vector-Space-Model
I have implemented ranked retrieval using vector space model. The docs are txt files. One can use this model to search aquery phrase in the document lists and the 10 most relevant (less if there are fewer than ten documents that have matching stems to the query) docIDs will be displayed. These documents are ordered by relevance, with the first document being most relevant.
